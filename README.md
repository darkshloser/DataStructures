# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains clean and well-documented implementations of essential data structures and useful algorithms in both Python and JavaScript, along with comprehensive unit tests for each.
It is designed for:

-   Learning and practicing key data structures
-   Comparing Python vs JavaScript syntax and behavior
-   Serving as boilerplate code or reference for larger projects
